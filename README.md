# [Hyperskill project] -> Coffee Machine (Kotlin)
This project allows you to better understand the basic OOP, its main concepts such as classes, class methods and attributes, and get a taste of Kotlin. Practice working with functions, challenge yourself with loops and conditions, and get more confident with OOP.

## About
What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how to do it. In this project, you will work on programming a coffee machine simulator. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino, and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money.

## What you'll learn
Once you choose a project, we'll provide you with a study plan that includes all the necessary topics from your course to get it built. Here’s what awaits you:

#### STAGE 1/6 Making coffee
Write a program that puts some basic information on the screen: let the machine describe what it takes to make a cup of coffee!

#### STAGE 2/6 Ingredient calculator
Program the machine to calculate the amount of ingredients it needs depending on how many people want some coffee.

#### STAGE 3/6 Estimate the number of servings
Working with conditions, program the machine to estimate how many creamy coffees it can make based on the amount of ingredients we enter.

#### STAGE 4/6 Buy, fill, take!
Teach your virtual coffee machine to perform three basic actions: collect the money, renew the supplies, and serve the coffee.

#### STAGE 5/6 Keep track of supplies
Program the machine to display on the screen the amount of supplies left. Set the main loop: now the menu keeps updating until you enter “exit”.

#### STAGE 6/6 Brush up your code
Time for some final touch-ups: structure the code so that it runs smoothly.


## Graduate project

This project covers the core topics of the Introduction to Kotlin course, making it sufficiently challenging to be a proud addition to your portfolio.
